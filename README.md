# Job Post Filter
 
This project uses various machine learning algorithms to create training and testing sets to predict if a job post is fraudulent.
This project was created for the "Applied Machine Learning" course at Villanova University in Spring 2021.
I worked on the project in conjunction with my peer Samuel Lademan.
